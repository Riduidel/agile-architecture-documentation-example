This container is responsible for displaying timetables in a "nice" UI.
This is the simplest possible Javascript application one can imagine: 

* the server-side component (all in `server.js`) provides
** a route to display the `index.html` page.
** a route to allow search in elsaticsearch index using specific criterias
* the client-side component (all in `index.html`) displays timetables from search engine results
